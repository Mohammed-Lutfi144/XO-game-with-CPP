# Title : XO-game-with-CPP
This repository is a final project I programmed after finishing the C++ course in college. I programmed a basic XO game that you can play with the computer only, then I considered that if I could promote it to the next level which you can play with your peers. To make this repository, I used the basics of C++ and classes using OOP technology to create a clean code. the program designed to have a Player Class that determines the features of each player such as markers and names of each one. Moreover, check XO function works to avoid playing with the same marker for each player. Then, at the main function, the user could choose to play with the computer or with his/her peer.

## functions that I use :
    1. design function works to display the edge and the shape of the game.
    2. play_With_friend function works to execute instructions that let you play with your peer.
    3. play_With_Computer function works to execute instructions that let you play with the computer.
    4. player_Move function works to let the player choose the place that he/she would like to display its mark on.
    5. computer_Move works to let the computer choose the place that would play on via random numbers.
    6. result function works to determine with player has won!.
    7. check_Win function works to check if someone has won!.
    8. check_Tie function works to determine if the game ends with Tie which means all spaces have been filled and no one has won.
